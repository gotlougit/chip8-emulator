# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Overview

This project aims to write a small and functional CHIP-8 emulator (or more accurately an interpreter, since CHIP-8 wasn't ever real hardware) in C using SDL to render the screen.

Right now a lot of the basic instructions are implemented, but it's not quite ready yet.

Note: the ```ibm.ch8``` ROM file is sourced from [this git repo](https://github.com/loktar00/chip8), and is included here temporarily for testing purposes.

## Origin

I am interested in learning more about computers, and emulation seemed like an interesting way to do so. I chose CHIP-8 because it would provide one of the simplest ways to get into this branch of computing, and followed the following guides to build this:

- A tutorial to [build a hypothetical VM](https://felix.engineer/blogs/virtual-machine-in-c), which was extremely simple as it only had a couple registers, instructions etc. While I ended up using very little of this tutorial's code, it did influence me in the initial commits. I actually built part of this tutorial and used it as the foundation before eventually changing the code drastically.

- This [excellent writeup](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) of CHIP-8 gives a lot of information regarding how to build the emulator, and explains the major opcodes as well without any code.
