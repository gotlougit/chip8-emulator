# CHIP-8 Emulator

## Overview

This project aims to write a small and functional CHIP-8 emulator (or more accurately an interpreter, since CHIP-8 wasn't ever real hardware) in C using SDL to render the screen.

Right now a lot of the basic instructions are implemented, but it's not quite ready yet.

Note: the ```ibm.ch8``` ROM file is sourced from [this git repo](https://github.com/loktar00/chip8), and is included here temporarily for testing purposes.
